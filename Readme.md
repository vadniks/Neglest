Learning OpenGL by trying to make a 2d game, it's gonna take much time... 

The 'Learn OpenGL - Graphics programming' book by Joey de Vries is used, 
as well as examples from there (https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL). 

This is now kinda a modified fork of the third-party repository 
(https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL/tree/master/src/7.in_practice/3.2d_game/0.full_source) 
just for learning purposes (so there's no any license here). 

There will be (probably) something original here in the future.
